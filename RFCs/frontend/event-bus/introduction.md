# Introduction

Event Bus is used to help organize interactions among components. The full list of events can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/GrapheryV2-Vue/blob/quasar2-dev/graphery-v2/src/components/mixins/controller/headquarter-bus.ts). The underlying lib is [`mitt`](https://github.com/developit/mitt). This directory will introduce the events and their workflows.
