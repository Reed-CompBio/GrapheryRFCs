# Introduction

Graphery is a website aiming to provide useful visualizations of the execution process of classic graph algorithms on biological networks. It has two independent parts: the frontend and the backend. This set of RFCs is used to layout the structures of the two units and to prescribe the design decisions and API specifications. 

The guidelines for creating and updating the RFCs are specified in the [guidelines.md](./guidelines.md) file. When you update the RFCs, you should follow the rules.
